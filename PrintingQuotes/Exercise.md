# 3. Printing Quotes

Create a program that prompts for a quote and an author. Display the quotation and author as shown in the example output.

## Example Output

    What is the quote? The secret of getting ahead is getting started.
    Who said it? Mark Twain
    Mark Twain says, "The secret of getting ahead is getting started."

## Constraints

* Prevent empty input.
* Use a single output statement to produce this output, using appropriate string-escaping techniques for quotes.
* Use string concatenation.

## Challenges

1. Create a structure that holds quotes and author. Show random quotes, every time the program starts.
2. Use a class.
