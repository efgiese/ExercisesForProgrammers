# 6. Retirement Calculator

Create a program that determines how many years you have left until retirement and the year you can retire. It should prompt for your current age and the age you want to retire and display the output as shown in the example that follows.

## Example Output

    What is your current age? 25
    At what age would you like to retire? 65
    You have 40 years left until you can retire.
    It's 2015, so you can retire in 2055.

## Constraints

* Prevent empty input.
* Ensure that you convert these values to numbers before doing the math.
* Get the current year from the system time via your programming language.

## Challenges

1. Handle situations where the program returns a negative number by stating that the user can already retire.
