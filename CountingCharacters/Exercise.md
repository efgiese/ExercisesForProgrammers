# 1. Counting the Number of Characters

Create an applicaton that prompts for an input string and prints the input string and the number of characters the string contains.

## Example Output

    What is the input string? Luther
    Luther has 6 characters.

## Constraint

* Be sure the output contains the original string.
* Use a single output statement to construct the output.
* Use a built-in-function of the programming language to determine the length of the string

## Challanges

1. Prevent empty input.
2. Implement the program using a GUI and update the character counter every time the key is pressed.
