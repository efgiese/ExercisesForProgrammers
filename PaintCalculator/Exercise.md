# 9. Paint Calculator

Calculate liter of paint needed to paint the ceiling of a room. Prompt for the length and width, and assume one liter covers 8 square meter. Display the number of liter needed to paint the ceiling as a whole number.

## Example Output

    You will need to purchase 10 liter of
    paint to cover 80 square meter.

Remember, you can’t buy a partial liter of paint. You must
round up to the next whole liter.

## Constraints

* Use a constant to hold the conversion rate.
* Ensure that you round up to the next whole number.

## Challenges

1. Revise the program to ensure that inputs are entered as numeric values. Don’t allow the user to proceed if the value entered is not numeric.
2. Implement support for a round room.
3. Implement support for an L-shaped room.
4. Implement a mobile version of this app so it can be used at the hardware store.
